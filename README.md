This is a fully-functional game of Nim for two players.

It was built using React, but you do NOT need to know React to build off of it.  You do need to know JavaScript though.

To start the project, clone this repo to your machine and run `npm install`.  Once that finishes, run `npm start`.  Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Inside the project, `src/helpers/AI.js` contains a stub of the `generateMove` function.  This will need to return an array with the three piles resulting from the move the AI chooses. You should only need to modify this file.
