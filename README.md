This is a fully-functional game of Nim for two players.

It was built using React, but you do NOT need to know React to build off of it.  You do need to know JavaScript though.

To start the project, clone this repo to your machine and run `npm install`.  Once that finishes, run `npm start`.  Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Inside the project, `src/App.js` contains the logic for managing the game state.  Add your AI methods here (or create helper files or a new component if you are more familiar with React).
